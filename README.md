# About Me Quiz

# Description
This is a quiz to get to know me. Users can answer multiple choice questions, get feedback if it's right or wrong, and view thier total score at the end.
This is made using React.

# Features
- Multiple-choice questions (6 questions)
- Feedback (Alerts say if it's correct or wrong)
- Score (Shows total score)
- Restart button
- Blue themed

# Motivation
I made this because I wanted to make a quiz because I made one in GWC and decided to try it in Athena but couldn't and I used the feedback that I got from my projects and decided to try something new.

# Challenges/Learned
I learned how to use React and make a quiz about myself.
A challenge was to learn react (since this is new to me)
